# aoc2021-haskell

Just a project with some haskell solutions.  Ignore Main, its a mess that works (for now).

Solutions are located in src/Solutions

## Running Solutions
If you have build the project into an exe you can run solutions the following ways:
```
λ> ./aoc2021-haskell [day] [part]
```

Day is required, part is optional (1 or 2)

### Example
To run day 3 part 1, or all of day 2:
```cmd
λ> ./aoc2021-haskell 3 1

λ> ./aoc2021-haskell 2
```
